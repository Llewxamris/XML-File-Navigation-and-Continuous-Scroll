# XML File Navigation and Continuous Scroll
An assignment in two parts.

## Part I. XML File Navigation. (jQuery)
Read in `clients.xml` to retrieve a list of clients, and their corresponding
`invoice.xml` file. Give users a dropdown box to select their wanted clients.
Based on the selected client, retrieve their invoices and allow the user to
iterate through that clients invoices. Include a search box that allows users
to search for a specific work number.

## Part II. Continuous Scroll
Dynamically load a list of users by calling `getUsers.php`, which returns a
list of users from `users.xml`. It should load in more users as the user
scrolls to the bottom of the page.
